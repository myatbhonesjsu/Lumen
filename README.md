### Data Models

#### SkinMetric
Stores skin analysis results:
- `skinAge`: Estimated skin age
- `overallHealth`: 0-100% health score
- `acneLevel`: Acne severity percentage
- `drynessLevel`: Dryness percentage
- `moistureLevel`: Moisture percentage
- `pigmentationLevel`: Pigmentation concerns
- `imageData`: Original photo
- `analysisNotes`: AI-generated insights

#### UserProfile
User preferences and settings:
- `name`: User's name
- `hasCompletedOnboarding`: Onboarding status
- `scanRemindersEnabled`: Notification preferences
- `privacySettingsAccepted`: Privacy consent

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16.0+
- macOS Sonoma or later
- iOS 18.6+ device or simulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Lumen
```

2. **Open in Xcode**
```bash
open Lumen.xcodeproj
```

3. **Build and Run**
- Select a simulator or connected device (iPhone recommended for full haptic experience)
- Press `Cmd + R` to build and run
- Grant camera and photo library permissions when prompted

### AWS Backend Deployment (Optional, Recommended for Production)

**Quick Deploy**:
```bash
cd aws-backend
./deploy.sh
```

**Time**: ~7 minutes | **Cost**: ~$19/month (10K users)

**What it deploys**:
- ✅ S3 bucket for image storage
- ✅ Lambda function for AI processing
- ✅ API Gateway for REST endpoints
- ✅ DynamoDB for results & products
- ✅ CloudWatch for monitoring
- ✅ (Optional) AWS Bedrock Agents for managed AI framework

**After deployment**:
1. Copy API endpoint URL from output
2. Update `aws-backend/ios-client/AWSBackendService.swift`:
   ```swift
   static let apiEndpoint = "YOUR_API_URL_HERE"
   ```
3. Add `AWSBackendService.swift` to Xcode project
4. Replace analysis service call (see integration guide)

**Full documentation**:
- 📖 `aws-backend/README.md` - Complete 500+ line guide
- ⚡ `aws-backend/QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Quick reference
- 🏗️ `AWS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture deep dive
- 🤔 `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` - Client vs AWS comparison

**Why use AWS backend?**
- ✅ API keys secure on backend (not in app)
- ✅ Scales to millions of users
- ✅ Update AI logic without app release
- ✅ Full analytics & monitoring
- ✅ AWS Bedrock Agents = managed agentic framework
- ✅ Production-grade infrastructure

### Camera Permissions
The app requires camera and photo library access. Privacy descriptions are configured in the project settings:
- **Camera**: "Lumen needs access to your camera to capture photos of your skin for AI-powered analysis and personalized skincare recommendations."
- **Photo Library**: "Lumen needs access to your photo library so you can select existing photos for skin analysis."
- **Photo Library Additions**: "Lumen would like to save your skin analysis photos to your photo library for your records."

**Note**: On first launch, tap the camera button to trigger the permission dialog.

## 📖 Usage Guide

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Privacy-First Design
- ✅ **Local Storage Only** - All data stored on device using SwiftData
- ✅ **No Account Required** - Use immediately without signup
- ✅ **No Cloud Sync** - Photos never leave your device
- ✅ **No Third-Party Sharing** - Zero data sharing
- ✅ **Easy Data Deletion** - Delete all data anytime from Settings

### Data Storage
- Photos: Stored as `Data` in SwiftData (encrypted at rest by iOS)
- Analysis Results: Local SQLite database (SwiftData)
- User Preferences: UserDefaults and SwiftData
- No network requests (current implementation uses mock data)
- All processing happens on-device
